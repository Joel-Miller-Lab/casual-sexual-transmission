# casual-sexual-transmission
Simulation of epidemics that spread through both sexual and casual transmission

Instructions on how to run each file are self-contained

The file DE_solution solves the IVP for the differential equations and plots the solution (Figure 1 of the paper)

The file Final_size_solution solves the transcendental equations for final state and plots the final size for different values of R_c and R_{s/s} (Figure 3 of the paper)

The file Final_state_solution solves the transcendental equations for final state and plots a heat map of difference between prob. of receiving a casual transmission and prob. of receiving a sexual transmission (Figure 3 of the paper)
